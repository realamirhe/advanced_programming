## Knights Tour

1. Use backtracking to try every possible move for the knight from a starting position.
2. Maintain a board where each cell is marked with the move number when visited.
3. For each move, attempt to move the knight to an unvisited square, checking if it stays within the board's boundaries.
4. If the knight successfully visits all squares, return the board. If a move leads to a dead-end, backtrack and try another.
5. Continue the process until a solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

## N Queens

1. Create an empty board and attempt to place queens row by row.
2. For each row, iterate over each column to check if placing a queen there is valid (i.e., no conflicts with other queens).
3. Use recursive backtracking to place queens in subsequent rows.
4. If a placement leads to a conflict in the next row, backtrack and try another position.
5. Once all queens are placed, store the solution. Repeat until all possible configurations are explored.

## Subset Sum

1. Start with an empty subset and recursively include/exclude each number from the set.
2. At each step, check if the current subset's sum equals the target.
3. If a subset with the target sum is found, add it to the result list.
4. Backtrack by excluding the current number and explore other possibilities.
5. Continue until all subsets have been explored.


## Solve Sudoku

1. Find an empty cell on the board.
2. Try placing each number (1 to 9) in the empty cell, and check if it's a valid placement (i.e., no conflicts in the row, column, or sub-grid).
3. If a valid number is placed, move on to the next empty cell using recursion.
4. If placing a number leads to an unsolvable state, backtrack by resetting the cell and trying the next number.
5. Continue the process until the board is completely filled or no solution is possible.

## M Coloring

1. Start from the first vertex and try assigning each color (from 1 to m) to it.
2. For each vertex, check if the color assignment is valid by ensuring no adjacent vertices have the same color.
3. Use recursion to assign colors to the next vertex. If assigning a color to the current vertex leads to a conflict later, backtrack by trying the next available color.
4. If all vertices are successfully colored, return True. If no valid coloring exists, return False.
