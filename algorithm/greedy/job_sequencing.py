def job_sequencing(jobs: list[tuple[int, int, int]]) -> list[int]:
    """
    Function to solve the Job Sequencing Problem with deadlines using a greedy algorithm.

    The Job Sequencing Problem is aimed at scheduling jobs in such a way that the maximum profit is obtained,
    given a set of jobs with associated deadlines and profits. Each job can take only one unit of time,
    and a job can only be scheduled before or on its deadline.

    Args:
    jobs (list[tuple[int, int, int]]): A list of jobs, where each job is represented as a tuple (job_id, deadline, profit).
        - job_id (int): Unique identifier of the job.
        - deadline (int): The latest time unit by which the job can be completed.
        - profit (int): The profit earned from completing the job.

    Returns:
    list[int]: A list of job_ids representing the sequence of jobs that maximizes the total profit.

    Time Complexity:
    - Sorting the jobs takes O(n log n), and scheduling takes O(n^2) in the worst case.

    Space Complexity:
    - O(n) for storing the time slots and the result sequence.

    Example:
    >>> jobs = [(1, 2, 100), (2, 1, 19), (3, 2, 27), (4, 1, 25), (5, 3, 15)]
    >>> job_sequencing_with_deadlines(jobs)
    [1, 3, 5]  # Job sequence yielding maximum profit
